# Icecast Install Script - DOESN'T WORK!!!
This script will quickly install Icecast to the current running directory and make a service to make it run at startup.

## Usage:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefCoders/icecast-install-script/refs/heads/main/install.sh -o icecast-install.sh
sh icecast-install.sh
```


## Reporting issues

Just make an issue and I'll respond.
